[HOOK]
take for instance
evolving human factor
not only the passive functions

never disconnected, part of your presence
5G network systems (spreading)
nanosensor data, synthetic aura
global brain from mobile

synthetic voices, silent at first
then spreading and self updating

thought algorithm
true symbiorelation
tattoo swiped (AI symbiote) 
auto(nomous) authentication
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the emerging picture
be impatient be impatient
just another texture
maze of your own making

[VERSE 1]
siren storage, pattern recognition
chains of our psyche, out of my moves, 
out of the framework, window of activity nonexistent
virtual bling saliva
dripping on your headset
jolting, grasp the handles
such is the thought algorithm 
escape clearly marked as an exit

how come it's just painted
what the fuck, 
wait it's painted black 
pixel structures on grid so dark
canvas still so empty, this cage is electric
the world seems to be turning
day will come, none of ya will heed it, analogues will start burning
true symbiotic relation
programme substitute for morals
hold on hands now dirty
intelligence

inner sense of data

[HOOK]
evolving human factor
not only the passive functions

never disconnected, part of your presence
5G network systems (spreading)
nanosensor data, synthetic aura
global brain from mobile

synthetic voices, silent at first
then spreading and self updating

as such is thought algorithm 
true symbiotic relation

tattoo swiped, autonomous 
authentication (AI symbiote) 
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the emerging picture
be impatient be impatient
just another texture
maze of your own making
