lies
i don't think you want this
unless you want to dash with the machine
take the key to escape

never disconnected
part of your presence
5G network systems
nanosensor data
synthetic aura
global brain 
from mobile
synthetic voices
silent at first
then spreading and 
self updating

[HOOK]
take for instance (?)

Evolving human factor
Not only the passive functions

Never disconnected
Part of your presence
5G network systems 
spreading)

Nanosensor data
Synthetic aura
Global brain 
From mobile

Synthetic voices
Silent at first
Then spreading and 
Self updating

Thought algorithm
True symbiorelation
Tattoo swiped (AI symbiote) 
Autonomous authentication

Lose yourself in the merge
Lose yourself in the merge
Lose yourself in the emerging picture
Be impatient be impatient

Just another texture (?)
Maze of your own making (?)

[VERSE 1]
hedges so programmed i can see
substitute for morals
inner sense of data
intelligence biohacking in the region
hold on hands now dirty
brace your eyes
brace your mind
the 4th is coming
malice with the burning

how come it's just painted
what the fuck, 
wait it's painted black 

Siren storage, pattern recognition
Chains of our psyche, out of my moves, 
Out of my framework, window of activity 
Nonexistent, virtual bling saliva, 
Dripping on your headset, jolting, grasp the handles
Such is the altered extinction process 
Escape clearly marked as an exit

[HOOK]
evolving human factor
not only the passive functions

never disconnected, part of your presence
5G network systems (spreading)
nanosensor data, synthetic aura
global brain from mobile

synthetic voices, silent at first
then spreading and self updating

as such is thought algorithm 
true symbiotic relation

tattoo swiped, autonomous 
authentication (AI symbiote) 
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the merge
lose yourself in the emerging picture
be impatient be impatient
just another texture
maze of your own making

[VERSE2]
how come it's faint
can feel the paint
painted in black
pixel structures on a grid so dark
canvas still so empty, cage is electric
the world seems to be turning
day will come, none of ya will heed it
analogues will start fading
plugged won't see it
surging for a different reason
out of wats, blinded yet alive
